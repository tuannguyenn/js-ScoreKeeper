I'm proud of this project because it is the first one I "coded" all by myself. I remember sitting down looking at the requirements and thinking "how on earth am I going to do this?"

After doing a bit of rubber duck debugging explaining the problem to a friend I got a few ideas on how to do it and got to work!
